# 2D-Platformer-Video-Game-on-Spartan-7-FPGA
In this lab, we designed and implemented a Super Mario Bros game with multiple levels, using the Xilinx Spartan-7 FPGA and the MicroBlaze processor. Additionally, we implemented the essential components using SystemVerilog, such as the keyboard and video display. Our goal was to demonstrate full control over the character's motion so that it reaches the end line of a platforming level. We were able to design an accurate dynamic collision detection using color mapping for multiple levels, add sound effects, display advanced graphics, manipulate text graphics, and control the characterâ€™s status (win/death).
